# PKMN-SV-Egg-collector

Pokemon SV - Egg Collector (MC only)
v.1.6.0

Features:
- Checks eggs every 1m30s, checking takes 30s meaning a cycle is 2m
- checks as if it has 9 eggs
- Auto Sandwich maker
- Does 12 cycles before re-making sandwich
- Closes dialogue so you don't get stuck and not generate eggs (this may mess up, idk why, currently finding a way to make it more consistent
- Whistle cancels whenever pressing B so you don't accidentally crouch (crouch glitch was a bit inconsistent and crouching wont allow you to interact with basket)
- Estimated an average of 45 eggs per 30m or 90 eggs per hour (SLOW AF compared to swsh)

I made this bc I don't have a full setup nor a pc I can casually leave on standby alongside my switch whenever I want to run a PA program
This only needs an arduino, plug in on the change grip controller menu like past programs and you're good to go

File included are already hex files.

PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO SCAN IT w/ antivirus always for precaution.

plss dm/ping me at Niffy#4428 if you find a bug/error... so I can fix it

 if you have a video of said error even better
